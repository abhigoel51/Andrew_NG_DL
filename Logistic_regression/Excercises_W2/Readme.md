# Workbook 1
Basics of Numpy, implementation of different function like sigmoid, softmax etc.

# Workbook 2 - Image classification

Complete flow of Logistic regresssion using numpy
Following functions are built 
1. Sigmoid function.
2. Initialise w,b.
3. Propgation (both backward and forward).
4. Optimise (num. of iterations to be run for reducing loss).
5. Model (put all the things together)
